# GenderClassifier
We can predict the gender of someone given a novel set of body metrics.


## Overview
This is the code for the gender classification.The code uses the scikit-learn machine learning library 
to train a models on a small dataset of body metrics (height, width, and shoe size) labeled male 
or female. Then we can predict the gender of someone given a novel set of body metrics.

This code for finding best model among KNN, Tree, and SVM.
